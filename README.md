# BucketList

This project is an app that lets the user build a private list of places on the map that they intend to visit one day, add a description for that place, look up interesting places that are nearby, and save it all to the iOS storage for later.

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

I learned how to:

- Add conformance to Comparable for custom types
- Write data to the documents directory
- Switch view states with enums
- Integrate MapKit with SwiftUI
- Communicate with a MapKit coordinator
- Use Touch ID and Face ID with SwiftUI

This app was made using the course **100 Days of SwiftUI** from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
